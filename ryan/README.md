# Crypto

I've put in a small dataset from Jan 1st, 2018 and included a somewhat broken list of coins and their trading name. The list of coins should be improved and pulled from an API.

The Jan 1st dataset includes all reddit comments on that day that were in a public subreddit containing the substring "crypto". This needs to be expanded to include "bitcoin" as /r/bitcoinmarkets is one of the biggest discussion points for altcoins as well. Similarly, /r/altcoin and anything relating to ICO's is probably worth including.
