Verify your account using driver\u2019s license and utility bill. Verification takes some time so you will have to be patient. Coinbase is where you will be purchasing your initial coins using dollars that you will then use for trading on the exchanges. \n\nOnce verified on Coinbase buy Ethereum (ETH) using credit card or bank withdrawal. Credit card is instant but has much lower limits. Bank withdrawal is 3-5 business days but allows a much larger amount. The reason you want ETH instead of Bitcoin (BTC) is that it has lower fees to purchase than BTC and most exchanges will allow you to buy the coin of your choice using ETH. \n\nNext, you want to open a GDAX account which is an exchange owned by Coinbase. You can trade for other coins here but the real reason you want this is so that you can transfer coins in from Coinbase and out from GDAX to the exchange of your choice, free of charge. Simply create your GDAX account using same credentials as Coinbase and then when you click deposit, select Coinbase as the source. \n\nLastly, set up an account with Binance or any other exchange you like. Find the address for the ETH wallet at Binance then go back to GDAX to withdraw. Enter your Binance ETH as the wallet destination. The transaction is initiated immediately but takes several minutes and sometimes hours to complete. My experience is that it\u2019s typically done in 10-15 minutes though. \n\nOnce the funds have arrived at Binance click on Markets. Select the coin you want to buy. In this case let\u2019s assume Ripple. Select the ETH/XRP trading pair. You will see the price of Ripple (XRP) in fractions of an ETH coin with an estimated dollar value next to it. Purchase the quantity you like at market value or by setting a limit order, which is essentially specifying how many you want to buy and at what price. If someone else is willing to sell at that price the order will go through. \n\nLast step is to setup a wallet for long term storage of your coin. Ripple has a decent free wallet called Toast Wallet. Download it onto your computer or as a iOS app. Follow the instructions to setup the wallet and copy the address. This is where you will be sending your XRP. \n\nGo back to Binance and withdraw the XRP, listing your Toast Wallet address as the destination. Now hold on to your investment and watch the price periodically which you can do on Binance itself or on a website called coinmarketcap.com. I suggest not checking too obsessively as it can lead to impulse trades.best strategy for someone starting out is to buy and hold a coin that you believe in for the long term. \n\nLastly, make sure you research anything you choose to invest in. Read the white paper, check out the dev and executive teams, read up on news and the roadmap, and determine if you think that coin has a future/usecase. \n\nHope this helps! \n\nEdit: I would suggest you start with a small amount until you get comfortable with the process. Also make sure you turn on 2FA on any service you sign up for. Be very careful when transfering coins, especially into exchanges, if you enter the wrong info you could lose your investment.

I am glad that you are not a BCH supporter and can see that Roger Ver is a con. So the reason why I got interested with Ripple is because I originally was interested in Litecoin. The failure that I see in litecoin and why Ripple is so attractive, comes down to leadership. Litecoin is failing hard because of Charlie Lee. He does not know how to market his product. After telling everyone to expect bearish markets, selling all of his coins, and then announcing that he is stepping away from litecoin after it comes back up a little....screams run away. That is when I started looking into Ripple and XRP. Even though most of the crypto community wants to see a completely decentralized, government and corporations hands off blockchain based currency that replaces fiat.....I don't feel that will ever happen, at least not in our lifetime. Ripple, at least to me, has the best chance at winning over the banking industry and the government and I feel that they will bring them to the crypto world. Your argument about XRP not being used, I feel may be misguided. Most of the Ripple community already knows that Ripple the company and XRP are not the same thing (except for newcomers of course), as the Ripple CEO and David Schwartz have been very transparent with this. Saying that XRP will never be used is a fallacy. Their Q3 report shows that they have sold ~$20 million worth of XRP to be used on xRapid with just the small number of banks (less than 100) they have signed up with their company now, meaning adoption is happening. It makes perfect sense to sell them the service (Ripple net) and then upsell the digital asset (XRP). Both Brad and David have been asked numerous times, what keeps banks from using their own blockchain....and their answer has always been nothing. They even help them with product development. Why? The same reason any business does, networking. Once a bank / financial institution sees the difficulty with implementing a good blockchain, they will ultimately end up using XRP. Take a look at Swift. Swift is who Ripple is looking to replace.....and so far is on track to do. Swift has been trying to implement their own blockchain technology but  it's not going very well, meanwhile Ripple has already held the Swell conference with major banks and financial institutions, building those bridges. This is why I feel that, in the end, the cryptos that have a strong team will end up going the distance, not winning (again i hate the NBA analogy as multiple cryptocurrencies can exist), but ultimately will exist.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["XRB, XRP?, XLM?"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514847114, "body": "Yes.

They will not gain like crazy nor will they dip like crazy.\n\nIf you look at the Efficient Frontier analysis curve of the Top 50 coins, all the altcoins have bigger gains and higher standard deviation i.e. risk. However all of them have been positive with gains well beyond the big coins. Of course in a true bear market where everything goes down, then as much as I hate to say it... back to fiat is probably the safest option. Personally I think that crypto is not a standard bubble, it is an adoption curve. As such it grows in bubbles and Gartner hype cycles. The Dec 2017 Hype cycle started before the Jan-Aug Hype cycle could die down, which I think is an inflexion point in worldwide crypto adoption. We may have short bear markets like with BTC now, but overall I think Crypto is going to get bigger and bigger rapidly over the next 3-5 years until it is ubiquitous.\n\nThere was a period with all the BTC forks this year where BTC was money badgering it up and gaining like a mofo, but December 2017 has been the tipping point for altcoins to boom. People in the crypto world are starting to realise it is more profitable to semi-actively invest and adjust their portfolio rather than hold onto the biggest coins (at least that's what I realised recently.)\n\nLISK and ARK, I don't know much about.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": [", ARK, LINK, etc.  "], "sentiment": 0.0}], "OMG": [{"time": 1514764898, "body": "I\u2019d put some in OMG.

I don't see any reason why Apple can't navigate through international regulation, it's something they do every day. Apple has a greater degree of support, influence, steady cash stream, etc. than the OMG project. It's hard not to envision Apple as a competitor in this space. \n\nEdit: also I would expect Apple's project to be a private chain. I recognize that a lot of people in the crypto world don't accept projects that are at all centralized, like Ripple or even Bitcoin. But I think that a realistic view of the next ten years recognizes that most consumers don't really understand what centralization vs. decentralization means, nor even recognize when they might be using blockchain/distributed ledger technology. So I don't expect that users will prefer decentralized projects. In fact I would expect most people to trust an Apple blockchain project even over something like Ethereum, since Ethereum is an indecipherable new brand with minimal achievements that could give it credibility (in contrast to the circumstances that gave rise to the ETH Classic fork), while Apple has one of the best reputations in all of the western large-corporate world. \n\nEdit 2: I just saw your edit quoting the \"what if\" thing from the video. I completely agree with you there. I dislike most of this video, and also the narrator is kind of unbearable. Half of that video should have been edited out....

I\u2019m going to talk about monero in comparison to verge, as it has the most solid privacy tech out there.\n\nMonero uses three privacy techniques to make all transactions private.\n\n(1) ring signatures: whenever you send a transaction, an algorithm automatically picks 4 other outputs and attaches them as dummies. You can prove that one of these outputs was the sender, but because of cryptographic properties it is not possible to prove which one \u2014 unless you sent it.\n\n(2) stealth addresses: no public address is ever stored on the blockchain. Basically, this is what wraith claims to do when it is enabled. It essentially creates a one-time hash of your address and some random data, so that your public address is never exposed at all.\n\n(3) Ring Confidential Transactions or ringCT. This is the newest improvement, and it essentially uses cryptography to conceal the transaction amounts. Verge has never claimed to be able to do this.\n\nThese are applied to all transactions in Monero, and this is important. Why? A few reasons:\n\n(1) optional privacy reduces the anonymity set! If fewer people use the privacy features, it is easier to determine who is sending private transactions.\n\n(2) optional privacy makes private transactions inherently suspicious (\u201cwhy did you use privacy?\u201d)\n\n(3) mandatory privacy is necessary to prevent coins from becoming tainted by their history! (You wouldn\u2019t want to own a coin that was owned by Pablo Escobar.)\n\nVerge, right now, has no privacy technology with regard to the blockchain. Wraith claims to enable optional stealth addresses, though that is basically one part of Monero\u2019s privacy, and it is far less effective when optional.\n\nHope I taught you something!

I said you're losing credibility by keeping the same copypasta from last week (which says they will meet their deadline). We all know they missed their deadline now. \n\nRegarding the trustworthiness of the Verge team, that is a matter of interpretation and opinion. Yes, the cryptosphere is the wild west, with lots of shitcoins and lack of business acumen.  That doesn't mean it is acceptable to miss deadlines, in my opinion.  For weeks, Verge made adamant promises that Wraith was code complete and ready for release except for some minor extraneous changes. They promised it would be released by the deadline of Q4 2017, yet Justin and team worked overboard the last two days with lots of failed builds and ultimately missed the deadline. Not only that, but they didn't communicate the status to the public in a responsible manner, causing many to lose thousands. Compare this with Icon, which you astutely recommended.  They pushed their release back three weeks and communicated clearly the status and ETA.  It has since rallied.\n\nI have some experience and have been the victim of arrogant and immature startup leaders, which has left me in a financial hole.

On their website, it prominently states \"Verge is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency, built with a focus on privacy.\" They claim to provide this privacy by hiding users' IP addresses. Let's take a dive into what this means and what this website is doing.\n\nWhen you send a transaction across the network, you connect to the nodes to tell them you would like for them to include this transaction in the next block. Typically, you connect to these nodes over the \"clearnet\", or normal internet. The nodes you communicate with know the IP address you use to communicate with them. This IP address could be from your house, a coffee shop, a VPN, etc.\n\nVerge claimed several times over several months/years to hide this IP address information by concealing behind Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P are privacy technologies that can work to conceal your IP address. Thus, if you use these systems to connect to these nodes, these nodes receive a masked IP address, not the real one. This breaks an association between your IP address and the transaction.\n\nTor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\nHowever, **IP obfuscation alone does not mean the transaction is private**. In Verge's case, transactions still show money transferring from one specific address to another. This is because the blockchain itself is transparent. Look at any Verge transaction, [such as this one](https://verge-blockchain.info/tx/91bc7992f3fd7827e71430873cf16418d3a6cdd968dd731682f99e3d948f4657). Money is clearly transferred from one address to others. This is all public information.\n\nSuppose you used a completely transparent cryptocurrency to buy coffee at your local shop. Tor isn't going to help you, since they can associate this transaction with you. They now know the wallet balance, all previous and future transactions associated with this address, and where the money you received came from.\n\nThat's because Tor and I2P are separate from cryptocurrencies. Sure, they can be added on top of cryptocurrencies to provide certain protections. However, you can use Tor to connect to pretty much anything.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's move on to what this website is doing. This website is connected to a Verge full node. This node is simply receiving transaction broadcasts from other users. These could be from the actual senders of the transaction, or they could be from other nodes that are simply relaying them. Since the network is relatively small, it's easy to capture a \"rough guess\" regarding the likely origins of these transactions.\n\nThe website simply records the IP address it receives these requests from. It's also trivial to make sure these are not Tor IP addresses, since these are indexed by several sites [like this one](https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes).\n\nEven though Verge claimed to hide this IP address, you can see that in practice, this feature is very infrequently used. Even in the latest \"wraith protocol\" wallet, IP address obfuscation is NOT included. You must manually obfuscate it by downloading Tor separately and manually configuring it, completely independent of Verge.\n\n---\n\nThis speaks to the wider issue of privacy being really hard to obtain, and the claims being really hard to verify. Nothing is ever \"perfectly private\" unfortunately, so that's an easy way to spot false/misleading claims. However, make sure to ask really critical questions of how privacy is afforded, or else you will be caught up in hot air like with Verge.", "sentences": ["Verge claims to be a privacy-centric cryptocurrency.", "On their website, it prominently states \"Verge is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency, built with a focus on privacy.\"", "Verge claimed several times over several months/years to hide this IP address information by concealing behind Tor or I2P.

I will try to explain it in the most non-technical way. \n\nWhat Enigma's main selling point is that it enables secure multi-party computations. What does that mean?\n\nFirstly, I want to point out that data is really valuable right now and will continue to be more valuable (because it enables you to drive insights, optimize your process, etc.). Enigma allows the computation on data while not having access to the data itself (this is one of their applications, which they are emerging from, so I will focus on this to explain Enigma). An example on how can this be so valuable in the real world:\n\nLet us say I am a pharmaceutical company that want to see some trend in patients with X disease. Currently, the whole process of getting access to the data is of very high friction since it involves giving the data as it is (unencrypted) allowing the buyer to see all personal information and the ability to resell it, reuse it, etc. With Enigma this contract would be set on the platform on what is called a secret contract where the buying company will do it's computations on the sellers data without actually knowing what the data is. They will pay ENG token as fees for running the computations and for storage, thus giving the token it's value.

I'd like to know why the coin is useful. From what I hear it's an erc20 so if ethereum has network troubles it has troubles. Alternatively if Ethereum scales this coin scales. Is it trying to make its own blockchain? I understand that making a token gives the developers money and the coin's price is not dependent on ethereum. But it doesn't seem like the coin is necessary. ~~ERC20 would have been fine.~~ Alternatively no coin would have been fine. A request network does not need a new coin.  \n\nIn fact adding middlemen just adds fees. How much does the Request Network company make on fees? How much do Req holders make? We started with crypto partly because we didn't want middlemen taking large fees. If Amazon or decentralized Amazon wanted to be paid in xrb or eth you could just send it to one of their wallets and then they'd ship you the item. Request isn't necessary in this model.  \n\nA lot of the shilling goes back to a few comments. One that they're backed by YC and therefore they're going to succeed. But many ycombinator startups fail. When dropbox got advisors ~~and funding~~ from ycombinator, there were 20 startups under ycombinator. [Now there's a hundred](http://yclist.com/). There's no way ycombinator can still give that level of support to all 100.  \n\n[Their team is not really well seasoned or experienced with starting successful companies, nor do they have very elegant websites. Most of what they have is mocks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7mbosu/dispelling_myths_about_request_network/)  \n\nInvesting will probably make you money because there's so much shilling for this coin, I just don't see it being that useful.  \n\nedit:  \n&gt;The costs we expect on the platform are 0.05% to 0.5% of the transaction. These costs will then decrease\nwhen the volume of the network increases in order to remain competitive and to avoid incentivizing the\ndevelopment of alternatives.  \n\nReading the whitepaper, req is burned on transactions for some reason.

I\u2019d be interested to see what they\u2019ve done to address the problems.\n\nHonestly, I may have come across too confident there. There are attempts at solving the issue using different network consensus algorithms or incentives for participants or nodes that process/store the ledger. There are a lot of parameters being tweaked--like an experiment in game theory for good economic behavior (or in some cases getting the founders rich).\n\nFor example, some cryptocurrencies like NEO pay a sort of dividend to those that hold a stake, or there are others that include governance via voting based on stake, etc. Some cryptocurrencies need miners like bitcoin needs miners, some make miners win popularity contests or hold stake to get rewards. There are also various varieties of cryptocurrency with different degrees of decentralization and anonymity, which correlates with how much you need to trust the system or it's participants. What I mention above is by no means exhaustive, just a smattering of what people are trying.\n\nIOTA for example abandons the blockchain as a data structure for the distributed ledger all together, instead using a cloud or tangle of transactions that verify other transactions. It also gets rid of miners and hides parts of this transaction cloud from other parts of the cloud. It has a very weird way of doing the same thing as a blockchain with smart contracts, except using sort of a probabilistic rather than deterministic approach. It's confusing for investors to understand it and I'm not sure it will catch on, but it's very different.\n\nFor example, a blockchain contract gets satisfied when a condition is true after some exact timestamp. A hypothetical for now IOTA contract would (theoretically) get satisfied once enough time passes and the tangle can reach a consensus that a condition is true with probability X.\n\n&gt;Why bother buying the basket now, if you believe it\u2019s currently speculation-driven pricing? Or maybe I\u2019m missing the point? or you believe the settle-in pricing is still ahead of us?\n\nI originally invested for a bit less than a quarter and made enough that I took out my original investment, and am working with profits only now in the portfolio. It was a sort of leg in, a trial. From now on I am setting goals of taking out profits (50%) each quarter and rebalancing. Part of this is learning for me as well, as I think in 5 years I could pivot into a career in the sector and this way it's real, with some incentives to do well and stick with it.\n\nI do think a lot of the prices are speculation driven, however on the flip side this asset class is based on very fast technology by comparison to other markets. It's possible it's just getting funded faster than anything we've ever seen before, like how the internet has accelerated media and other things people used to spend more time having to create or do.\n\nAnyway, I think it's possible a portion of the value right now is supported underneath by something fundamental. The ICO market for example is funding more to startups than angel investors. Some of the value in a token like Ethereum is in it's use for that ICO system. So, in my mind, it's worth putting a little money in early in case it pays off. The risk is at most very minimal to my well being with what I have in it.\n\nThe technology alone is very game-changing, I feel that in my head more than my heart. My heart tells me the investors in this space shouldn't be called that. Still, we've seen tokens grow a ridiculous amount so it's possible one pays off pretty big, relatively speaking to the dollar amount in (I wont be a millionaire).

Their ability to scale concerns me, but maybe one of their solutions will work.  Good dev team and thoughtful approach. \n\nXMR: Most complete privacy coin.  It is interesting though, because their users are actually using it to spend on the dark market and the fees are going to jeopardize thier initial advantage.  I think a low fee privacy based DAG based coin could steal their thunder.  However, they have a great use case as \"Swiss Bank 2.0\".  This is a real need and a better \"store of value\" than BTC.\n\nIOTA:  M2M economy (at first).  This coin reminds me of Amazon in the early days when they only did books.  I am not sure what a blockchain can do better than the tangle.  If this one gets adoption it will actually be hard to stop the momentum because with increased nodes it will have faster confirmations.  This is a \"TRUE\" network effect, similar to ebay in the auction space.  The network effect increases the network, unlike blockchain based coins that get slower and fees increase.  Also, organizations won't want 50 tangles, they will want as few as possible so there is less friction.\n\nOverall, I see these coins remaining in a few years as other come and go.

The transactions with timestamps previous to the snapshot block are erased (from the vast majority of nodes, there are also some historic nodes that never delete anything).\n\nIn the future, those snapshots won't be global events for all the network, but will instead be carried out automatically by each node on their own as they approach their storage capacity limits.

I began following Bitcoin in 2011/2012 and Litecoin, Vertcoin, Dogecoin, and many others after that. I never saw these prospects as ways to get rich, I saw them as possibilities for a better future, and DOGE was just a joke if I'm being honest, can't believe it hit a 1B MCap.

(I know some in the new wave *do* care about it, but most dont') They want a piece of the pie.\n\nThese newcomers get most of their advice/ideas from the early adopters though. Let's be real, these newcomers don't know what they are talking about and can't come up with an original idea in the cryptospace, they just follow the herd leader. So when that herd leader, like Parabolic Trav (who I hate), hypes up IOTA turning off the coordinator (when they do) all these new crypto adopters will hop on board. They will have no idea why coordinator being off is a big deal but they will know that it is and hop in because the herd leaders are making mention of it.\n\nThese same herd leaders also lead to coins becoming extremely overvalued *cough* VERGE *cough*.\n\nPoint is that while newcomers don't care about tech/decentralization the people they are following and basing their investment decisions off of do so any big tech/decen announcements will cause a wave of new money.\n\nLet's remember that some people are already up over 10x on IOTA (like me).

I\u2019d be interested to see what they\u2019ve done to address the problems.\n\nHonestly, I may have come across too confident there. There are attempts at solving the issue using different network consensus algorithms or incentives for participants or nodes that process/store the ledger. There are a lot of parameters being tweaked--like an experiment in game theory for good economic behavior (or in some cases getting the founders rich).\n\nFor example, some cryptocurrencies like NEO pay a sort of dividend to those that hold a stake, or there are others that include governance via voting based on stake, etc. Some cryptocurrencies need miners like bitcoin needs miners, some make miners win popularity contests or hold stake to get rewards. There are also various varieties of cryptocurrency with different degrees of decentralization and anonymity, which correlates with how much you need to trust the system or it's participants. What I mention above is by no means exhaustive, just a smattering of what people are trying.\n\nIOTA for example abandons the blockchain as a data structure for the distributed ledger all together, instead using a cloud or tangle of transactions that verify other transactions. It also gets rid of miners and hides parts of this transaction cloud from other parts of the cloud. It has a very weird way of doing the same thing as a blockchain with smart contracts, except using sort of a probabilistic rather than deterministic approach. It's confusing for investors to understand it and I'm not sure it will catch on, but it's very different.\n\nFor example, a blockchain contract gets satisfied when a condition is true after some exact timestamp. A hypothetical for now IOTA contract would (theoretically) get satisfied once enough time passes and the tangle can reach a consensus that a condition is true with probability X.\n\n&gt;Why bother buying the basket now, if you believe it\u2019s currently speculation-driven pricing? Or maybe I\u2019m missing the point? or you believe the settle-in pricing is still ahead of us?\n\nI originally invested for a bit less than a quarter and made enough that I took out my original investment, and am working with profits only now in the portfolio. It was a sort of leg in, a trial. From now on I am setting goals of taking out profits (50%) each quarter and rebalancing. Part of this is learning for me as well, as I think in 5 years I could pivot into a career in the sector and this way it's real, with some incentives to do well and stick with it.\n\nI do think a lot of the prices are speculation driven, however on the flip side this asset class is based on very fast technology by comparison to other markets. It's possible it's just getting funded faster than anything we've ever seen before, like how the internet has accelerated media and other things people used to spend more time having to create or do.\n\nAnyway, I think it's possible a portion of the value right now is supported underneath by something fundamental. The ICO market for example is funding more to startups than angel investors. Some of the value in a token like Ethereum is in it's use for that ICO system. So, in my mind, it's worth putting a little money in early in case it pays off. The risk is at most very minimal to my well being with what I have in it.\n\nThe technology alone is very game-changing, I feel that in my head more than my heart. My heart tells me the investors in this space shouldn't be called that. Still, we've seen tokens grow a ridiculous amount so it's possible one pays off pretty big, relatively speaking to the dollar amount in (I wont be a millionaire). However your mention of the regulatory wild card is absolutely spot on, and I do believe we're in a Bitcoin bubble.

First vesting as soon as crowdsale concludes.\n\n&gt; Advisors\n&gt; 3 percent of the total BNTY supply will be allocated to advisors and is subject to a 6 months vesting period. First vesting as soon as crowdsale concludes.\n\n\nA good sign in that three of the six members of the team are software developers (6+ years experience in web/enterprise). The lead developer has a full-time job \"Working in Applied Innovation team on Blockchain/Ethereum projects\" so he is picking up valuable experience in the crypto sphere. Additionally, they have an advisor with blockchain experience. Hopefully, with the crowdsale money they can expand the team even further.\n\n\nI see a lot of promise in the coin.

Ark, OMG, Kyber, and 0x, are just a few of the more popular coins that are trying to solve that problem.\n\nKeep in mind that some people think lightning network, and atomic swaps may make these obsolete.\n\nArk uses a system they call smartbridges, which involves putting a little bit of code into the core code of other blockchains to allow it to connect to ark. Obviously this will be highly dependent on other blockchains adopting it.\n\nOMG is really interesting cause Omise is already a well established company in Asia. This means they already have all the inroads and connections once the tech is ready. Furthermore, they have a great development team including Vitalik Buterin as an advisor.\n\nKyber Network is a decentralized exchange on ethereum. Initially they will do Ethereum tokens only, but they plan to expand to cross chain in early 2019.\n\n0x is similar to Kyber, except essentially it's just a protocol written to allow transfers of different eth tokens. The idea being, anyone that wants that functionality can simply integrate the 0x protocol rather than create their own from scratch.

I am not sure what a blockchain can do better than the tangle.  If this one gets adoption it will actually be hard to stop the momentum because with increased nodes it will have faster confirmations.  This is a \"TRUE\" network effect, similar to ebay in the auction space.  The network effect increases the network, unlike blockchain based coins that get slower and fees increase.  Also, organizations won't want 50 tangles, they will want as few as possible so there is less friction.\n\nOverall, I see these coins remaining in a few years as other come and go.

I've thought about that recently too... I'll outline why I'm so bullish on alts for the current market climate and probably most of Q1 2018 unless BTC makes a big change to transaction times and fees.\n\nI remember that period well. March-June when ICO mania was ripe, Ethereum and the alts had pumped like crazy while BTC was growing too. BTC dominance went from 84% to 37% and there was talk of the flippening with Ethereum.\n\nThen ETH corrected in mid-June which is when all the alts started to decline as well. After that period was the BTC politics saga which saw BCH fork uncertainty dip, China FUD dip, BCH dip. BTC was centre stage for a good portion of the latter half of 2017. BTC pumped like the money badger it is for good reason, cause it had all the attention. Alts suffered for a while until mid-December. During this period we saw BTC dominance go from 37% up to 63%.\n\nI think the current alt mania is not like the alt mania in early 2017. Alts now have had the extra time to develop and mature. We are seeing stronger teams with big partnerships in the general alt market. Of course most alts will fail, but there are a handful of gems that will do well, I think better than BTC in 2018. Which is why it's so important to DYOR i feel.\n\nLike all things, there will be cycles. The biggest coins won't be going away, that's for sure. And they will have periods where they perform better than alts, that's for sure too. Overall the market as a whole will continue going up in 2018, progressing towards widespread mainstream adoption. I think sometime between 2020-2025 crypto will be literally everywhere even if the average person still doesn't know about it.\n\nThe BIG COIN/ALT COIN cycle seems to be a relatively slow trend though (see https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) at the bottom for BTC dominance fluctuation. In general the market sentiment seems to be pretty sick of BTC transaction times and slowness, and I don't see that problem getting any better anytime soon.

Both are fine as long as you know good and well it can easily become 0 very quickly. This is a real question you need to deliberate.\n\nNext, once you decide that, choose an exchange you can trade fiat for crypto. Coinbase is an easy gateway and the choice for a lot of people. Is it the best? IDK but it's popular because it is easy.\n\nNext you need to decide what you want to invest in. You may decide to just hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum which can be bought and held on Coinbase if you choose.\n\nIf you are interested in alt coins, DO YOUR RESEARCH! Don't just buy into the flavor of the month because everyone else is. Read the coins white paper. See what the long term plan is. Who the developers are. Have they hit their goals on the road map? Are they working towards big partnerships? Invest in coins you believe in! Then just hold. Don't day trade. Find what you think can make it big and just hold the shit. I don't know how many posts show up a day talking about people starting to day trade and losing it all when if they just held, they probably would have doubled their investment.\n\nIf you pursue alt coins there are several ways to do it. You would need to move funds into an exchange. Again, Binance is a popular one for Americans. Some people like it, some people don't. You will have to read about them to figure out what works for you.\n\nIf you buy on Coinbase there are some exchange tricks where you can pretty much move the money for free. Otherwise there is going to be fees for moving the money around. I don't really suggest buying bitcoin with the intent to move it to an exchange because it's really slow and has high fees right now. Litecoin and Ethereum are better suited for this process right now.\n\nI think my biggest point here, and where I'll end this post is that you need to read. A lot.

You can trade for other coins here but the real reason you want this is so that you can transfer coins in from Coinbase and out from GDAX to the exchange of your choice, free of charge. Simply create your GDAX account using same credentials as Coinbase and then when you click deposit, select Coinbase as the source. \n\nLastly, set up an account with Binance or any other exchange you like. Find the address for the ETH wallet at Binance then go back to GDAX to withdraw. Enter your Binance ETH as the wallet destination. The transaction is initiated immediately but takes several minutes and sometimes hours to complete. My experience is that it\u2019s typically done in 10-15 minutes though. \n\nOnce the funds have arrived at Binance click on Markets. Select the coin you want to buy. In this case let\u2019s assume Ripple. Select the ETH/XRP trading pair. You will see the price of Ripple (XRP) in fractions of an ETH coin with an estimated dollar value next to it. Purchase the quantity you like at market value or by setting a limit order, which is essentially specifying how many you want to buy and at what price. If someone else is willing to sell at that price the order will go through. \n\nLast step is to setup a wallet for long term storage of your coin. Ripple has a decent free wallet called Toast Wallet. Download it onto your computer or as a iOS app. Follow the instructions to setup the wallet and copy the address. This is where you will be sending your XRP. \n\nGo back to Binance and withdraw the XRP, listing your Toast Wallet address as the destination. Now hold on to your investment and watch the price periodically which you can do on Binance itself or on a website called coinmarketcap.com. I suggest not checking too obsessively as it can lead to impulse trades.best strategy for someone starting out is to buy and hold a coin that you believe in for the long term. \n\nLastly, make sure you research anything you choose to invest in. Read the white paper, check out the dev and executive teams, read up on news and the roadmap, and determine if you think that coin has a future/usecase. \n\nHope this helps! \n\nEdit: I would suggest you start with a small amount until you get comfortable with the process. Also make sure you turn on 2FA on any service you sign up for. Be very careful when transfering coins, especially into exchanges, if you enter the wrong info you could lose your investment.

To get a little more discussion about the tech and its competitors\n\nSo, [what is Loopring?](https://loopring.org/en/index.html) Loopring \"is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading.\" The protocol seeks to pool the liquidity of cryptocurrency's. It is an *agnostic protocol* that can be operated on any program that operates Smart Contracts. LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to \"put it all their eggs in one basket.\" \n\nLoopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology. To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. \n\nLoopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: \n\n* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, \n\n* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and \n\n* as a cross-platform protocol. \n\nAdditionally, the Dev team released their [2018 Road Map](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669), which contains realistic goals for the year. I'd really like to point out one tidbit of information:\n\n* \"For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. **For each LRC you buy and hodl**, within some time in Q1 and Q2 **you'll receive an equivalent amount of LRx tokens for Qtum and NEO.** \n\n[Blockchain Brad had a really good interview with Daniel, that helped share his vision and talent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA5zgPvDdjE) \n\nI hope this came off as educational, and not too shill-ish.

Is it trying to make its own blockchain? I understand that making a token gives the developers money and the coin's price is not dependent on ethereum. But it doesn't seem like the coin is necessary. ~~ERC20 would have been fine.~~ Alternatively no coin would have been fine. A request network does not need a new coin.  \n\nIn fact adding middlemen just adds fees. How much does the Request Network company make on fees? How much do Req holders make? We started with crypto partly because we didn't want middlemen taking large fees.

These costs will then decrease\nwhen the volume of the network increases in order to remain competitive and to avoid incentivizing the\ndevelopment of alternatives.  \n\nReading the whitepaper, req is burned on transactions for some reason. Also the fees will start at around .5% which is debit levels.  \n\nERC20 would not have been fine as it would allow anyone with an erc20 token to be part of the REQ token governance.

On their website, it prominently states \"Verge is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency, built with a focus on privacy.\" They claim to provide this privacy by hiding users' IP addresses. Let's take a dive into what this means and what this website is doing.\n\nWhen you send a transaction across the network, you connect to the nodes to tell them you would like for them to include this transaction in the next block. Typically, you connect to these nodes over the \"clearnet\", or normal internet. The nodes you communicate with know the IP address you use to communicate with them. This IP address could be from your house, a coffee shop, a VPN, etc.\n\nVerge claimed several times over several months/years to hide this IP address information by concealing behind Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P are privacy technologies that can work to conceal your IP address. Thus, if you use these systems to connect to these nodes, these nodes receive a masked IP address, not the real one. This breaks an association between your IP address and the transaction.\n\nTor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\nHowever, **IP obfuscation alone does not mean the transaction is private**. In Verge's case, transactions still show money transferring from one specific address to another. This is because the blockchain itself is transparent. Look at any Verge transaction, [such as this one](https://verge-blockchain.info/tx/91bc7992f3fd7827e71430873cf16418d3a6cdd968dd731682f99e3d948f4657). Money is clearly transferred from one address to others. This is all public information.\n\nSuppose you used a completely transparent cryptocurrency to buy coffee at your local shop. Tor isn't going to help you, since they can associate this transaction with you. They now know the wallet balance, all previous and future transactions associated with this address, and where the money you received came from.\n\nThat's because Tor and I2P are separate from cryptocurrencies. Sure, they can be added on top of cryptocurrencies to provide certain protections. However, you can use Tor to connect to pretty much anything.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's move on to what this website is doing. This website is connected to a Verge full node. This node is simply receiving transaction broadcasts from other users. These could be from the actual senders of the transaction, or they could be from other nodes that are simply relaying them. Since the network is relatively small, it's easy to capture a \"rough guess\" regarding the likely origins of these transactions.\n\nThe website simply records the IP address it receives these requests from. It's also trivial to make sure these are not Tor IP addresses, since these are indexed by several sites [like this one](https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes).\n\nEven though Verge claimed to hide this IP address, you can see that in practice, this feature is very infrequently used. Even in the latest \"wraith protocol\" wallet, IP address obfuscation is NOT included. You must manually obfuscate it by downloading Tor separately and manually configuring it, completely independent of Verge.\n\n---\n\nThis speaks to the wider issue of privacy being really hard to obtain, and the claims being really hard to verify. Nothing is ever \"perfectly private\" unfortunately, so that's an easy way to spot false/misleading claims. However, make sure to ask really critical questions of how privacy is afforded, or else you will be caught up in hot air like with Verge.", "sentences": ["Tor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\n"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514841264, "body": "Didn't wanna spend any of my ETH to buy VEN right now, so spent some BNB which hasn't been rising like I expected.\n\nLet's hope VEN works for me!", "sentences": ["Didn't wanna spend any of my ETH to buy VEN right now, so spent some BNB which hasn't been rising like I expected.\n\n"], "sentiment": 1.0}, {"time": 1514841569, "body": "When you want to play the accumulation game just watch either ETH or BTC prices compared to your coin of choice.\n\nI'm on Binance btw.\n\nIf you're playing to grab more coins the only thing that matters is that, since you can't trade for $USD.\n\nIn any case, selling 25% of your coins at what you think is a high before a dip is always a good thing imo.

The Dragon has so much more utility than just a way to get discounts for ICO's - you are either lying or you are too lazy to do more than 5 minutes of research. Unfortunately for you, I did my due diligence and will describe in detail what gives DRGN utility and increasing demand as the platform matures --\n\nA Dragon is legally a micro-license for intellectual property on the blockchain. It therefore has many uses:\n\n* DRGN's need to be acquired and held by companies to access the Incubator services. I am not sure how many DRGN's they have to hold to get access, but it will absolutely drive demand. Dragonchain is primed to become the first  Kickstarter ICO platform where under-resourced companies will get all of the legal and expert advice they need to launch a blockchain. Dragons are the fuel of the incubator -- with 150 companies already signed up for the incubator, I am sure the price movement is coming from real companies who want to use the platform.\n\n* Also, all incubator projects must include a special discount during their ICO for DRGN holders. The quality of the discount will be determined by your **Dragon Slumber Score**. The DSS is determined by: Length of time your Dragons are held * Number of Dragons held. DSS is a great incentive to hold your tokens for some juicy ICO discounts. Here is a new DSS Calculator from Dragonchain! Just enter your ETH address to calculate. Pretty cool.\n\n* DRGN's are required to pay for the turn-key products available in the Marketplace. Developers can determine the payment method (one time, subscription, a fee per API call, etc.). So companies will need to acquire DRGN's on a recurring basis to use the products on the Marketplace. Since Dragonchain is marketing early on towards lower resourced companies, there will be a very high demand for the products available in the Marketplace (since these companies won't be able to develop their own).\n\n* DRGN's will also be required to spin up nodes and to call / execute smart contracts. So even if a giant like Google adopts the platform, they will need to have DRGN's to do the basic blockchain functions.\n\nFinally - Here is a great official video about how to use the tokens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDf88Omur80\n\n", "sentences": ["Just enter your ETH address to calculate."], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514844453, "body": "&gt; This is true for coins and applications that RUN and rely on the ETH network.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.

I\u2019m going to talk about monero in comparison to verge, as it has the most solid privacy tech out there.\n\nMonero uses three privacy techniques to make all transactions private.\n\n(1) ring signatures: whenever you send a transaction, an algorithm automatically picks 4 other outputs and attaches them as dummies. You can prove that one of these outputs was the sender, but because of cryptographic properties it is not possible to prove which one \u2014 unless you sent it.\n\n(2) stealth addresses: no public address is ever stored on the blockchain. Basically, this is what wraith claims to do when it is enabled. It essentially creates a one-time hash of your address and some random data, so that your public address is never exposed at all.\n\n(3) Ring Confidential Transactions or ringCT. This is the newest improvement, and it essentially uses cryptography to conceal the transaction amounts. Verge has never claimed to be able to do this.\n\nThese are applied to all transactions in Monero, and this is important. Why? A few reasons:\n\n(1) optional privacy reduces the anonymity set! If fewer people use the privacy features, it is easier to determine who is sending private transactions.\n\n(2) optional privacy makes private transactions inherently suspicious (\u201cwhy did you use privacy?\u201d)\n\n(3) mandatory privacy is necessary to prevent coins from becoming tainted by their history! (You wouldn\u2019t want to own a coin that was owned by Pablo Escobar.)\n\nVerge, right now, has no privacy technology with regard to the blockchain.

Decred, of course, seems like a good one, too, but I'm not sure if I like it since it is only a currency and it's hard for me to get behind when I have experienced Steem and XRB transactions. On a meta-level, I am of course also very into Aragon, since it enables people to govern in a decentralized manner.\n\nXMR *almost* has this on lock. I'm not sure I fully understand it. They have self-funding, but I don't think they have a true governance model. This could pose problems.\n\nOnto the tech. I am super super excited for District0x. The concept of a WYSIWYG marketplace creation toolset along the lines of Wordpress seems super super cool to me. The easier it is to create dApps, the more dApps we will have. The more dApps we have, the more chances we get to launch dApps that result in mass adoption. Toolsets like this are always great projects to get involved with, because creating just *one strong and useful toolkit* can result in *thousands* of projects being launched. \n\nI'm excited for Steemit right now, because it just lines up so perfectly with the concept of incentives and market rewards and how cryptos gain value. Cryptos gain value from more people being aware of and buying them? Cool, let's create a platform where we *pay* content-creators and curators to create awesome content to bring awareness to this crypto. \n\nBitshares is great because it literally operates how you would expect an exchange to. This is miles ahead of something like Etherdelta, and it's clear from using Bitshares that Ethereum's block times would have never cut it for a dApp like this that needs fast processing. On top of that *it literally solves the tether problem*. Bitshares has created a system for minting USD-pegged and commodity-pegged crypto assets in a decentralized and trustless way. Why something like Tether is even still around with the existence of something like bitUSD or even bitGOLD as an alternative is truly beyond me.

I did NOT say that you're losing credibility for recommending XVG last week, or for being wrong about it. I said you're losing credibility by keeping the same copypasta from last week (which says they will meet their deadline). We all know they missed their deadline now. \n\nRegarding the trustworthiness of the Verge team, that is a matter of interpretation and opinion. Yes, the cryptosphere is the wild west, with lots of shitcoins and lack of business acumen.  That doesn't mean it is acceptable to miss deadlines, in my opinion.  For weeks, Verge made adamant promises that Wraith was code complete and ready for release except for some minor extraneous changes. They promised it would be released by the deadline of Q4 2017, yet Justin and team worked overboard the last two days with lots of failed builds and ultimately missed the deadline. Not only that, but they didn't communicate the status to the public in a responsible manner, causing many to lose thousands. Compare this with Icon, which you astutely recommended.  They pushed their release back three weeks and communicated clearly the status and ETA.  It has since rallied.\n\nI have some experience and have been the victim of arrogant and immature startup leaders, which has left me in a financial hole.  Now I'm managing digital transformation for a $60B/year company, and I can tell you with some certainty that the last minute shenanigans and code changes show a lack of professionalism that will cost Verge dearly with regards to public sentiment, which is key to success in currency adoption.\n\nFurthermore, I'm finding that the stealth code for wraith is questionable. Lots of variables are hard coded rather than abstracted out, and it is eerily similar to XSPEC's code. I personally believe other currencies with better acumen are currently working to implement similar features to Wraith.  This takes away from the novelty of Verge. If there's one thing I've learned in business, it is to never underestimate your competition.

Acme Widget Corporation has been in business for 80 years and has established themselves as a reputable manufacturer and seller of widgets that has always conducted business in an ethical way. They accept ::name your favorite optional privacy coin::, but one day we discover that Acme has actually been engaging in fraudulent activity for a period of 10 years a few decades ago. During that time, 80 percent of their customer base and business partners/suppliers chose not to opt-in for the privacy because they didn\u2019t want the added complexity and/or costs.\n\nNow a large number of coins can be traced back to the \u201cdark times\u201d of ACME and are scrutinized over other coins that should have equal value. Environmentalists, activists, etc outright refuse to accept payment from addresses whose inputs trace back to the tainted coins. Banks in China or Germany and a few others refuse to allow banking deposits from transactions that are traced to the tainted coins. A few merchants whose peers accuse them of \u201cloose morals\u201d are willing to accept payment for goods/services with those coins, but with a 20% markup due to the inconvenience it causes them.\n\nWhile my example is very specific, a lot can happen in a couple hundred years. It doesn\u2019t take heinous things like drugs or human trafficking to cause groups of people to argue that your coins are worth less than their \u201cclean coins\u201d or are essentially worthless. That can\u2019t happen if you want a coin to succeed long term. One coin absolutely must be of equal value to another and this must remain true for centuries or even millennia.\n\nThe drug deals are an obvious taint. What happens when things are seemingly okay now and later on we find out different? Now it\u2019s too late for everyone to have done their due diligence and turn on privacy.

On their website, it prominently states \"Verge is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency, built with a focus on privacy.\" They claim to provide this privacy by hiding users' IP addresses. Let's take a dive into what this means and what this website is doing.\n\nWhen you send a transaction across the network, you connect to the nodes to tell them you would like for them to include this transaction in the next block. Typically, you connect to these nodes over the \"clearnet\", or normal internet. The nodes you communicate with know the IP address you use to communicate with them. This IP address could be from your house, a coffee shop, a VPN, etc.\n\nVerge claimed several times over several months/years to hide this IP address information by concealing behind Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P are privacy technologies that can work to conceal your IP address. Thus, if you use these systems to connect to these nodes, these nodes receive a masked IP address, not the real one. This breaks an association between your IP address and the transaction.\n\nTor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\nHowever, **IP obfuscation alone does not mean the transaction is private**. In Verge's case, transactions still show money transferring from one specific address to another. This is because the blockchain itself is transparent. Look at any Verge transaction, [such as this one](https://verge-blockchain.info/tx/91bc7992f3fd7827e71430873cf16418d3a6cdd968dd731682f99e3d948f4657). Money is clearly transferred from one address to others. This is all public information.\n\nSuppose you used a completely transparent cryptocurrency to buy coffee at your local shop. Tor isn't going to help you, since they can associate this transaction with you. They now know the wallet balance, all previous and future transactions associated with this address, and where the money you received came from.\n\nThat's because Tor and I2P are separate from cryptocurrencies. Sure, they can be added on top of cryptocurrencies to provide certain protections. However, you can use Tor to connect to pretty much anything.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's move on to what this website is doing. This website is connected to a Verge full node. This node is simply receiving transaction broadcasts from other users. These could be from the actual senders of the transaction, or they could be from other nodes that are simply relaying them. Since the network is relatively small, it's easy to capture a \"rough guess\" regarding the likely origins of these transactions.\n\nThe website simply records the IP address it receives these requests from. It's also trivial to make sure these are not Tor IP addresses, since these are indexed by several sites [like this one](https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes).\n\nEven though Verge claimed to hide this IP address, you can see that in practice, this feature is very infrequently used. Even in the latest \"wraith protocol\" wallet, IP address obfuscation is NOT included. You must manually obfuscate it by downloading Tor separately and manually configuring it, completely independent of Verge.\n\n---\n\nThis speaks to the wider issue of privacy being really hard to obtain, and the claims being really hard to verify. Nothing is ever \"perfectly private\" unfortunately, so that's an easy way to spot false/misleading claims. However, make sure to ask really critical questions of how privacy is afforded, or else you will be caught up in hot air like with Verge.", "sentences": ["Tor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\n"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514841297, "body": "You act like it's some sort of PR team.

Again, VeChain does not make their own chips. They outsource them. They're using RFIDs that are not made specifically with blockchain in mind, and re-purposing them for use with blockchain through API. Walton on the other hand is a world leader in chip technology. They've made significant improvements to their RFID chip including: anti-collision logic which reduces the probability of skipping; low voltage and low power consumption which allows the RFID to last for more than 20 years; dissymmetric encryption and decryption module for safer tag communication; a dedicated storage space for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information, which makes the tag content truly tamper-resistant; the ability to read and write to the blockchain independently without human intervention; and more, such as the ability to detect minute movements, and other sensing capabilities. They've won multiple awards from the Chinese National Government for their hardware, and they've received govt subsidies for mass production and a serial run of their product.\n\nAs for software, we won't know the organizational structure of the VeChain Thor blockchain, so we can't compare yet because we don't know the specifics of what it's capable of. But Walton uses a dual-chain blockchain with sub chains that are independent but can sync to the dual-chain with their unique cross-bridging tech they developed. No other blockchain has this exact system. This allows for theoretically infinite scalability.\n\nSo why is Walton rank 81? For the same reason fucking Hshare has over a billion dollar market cap, even though it's a scam. Because this market is irrational as hell. Walton used to be rank 28 just a couple months ago. It had a bull run before most other projects did. It was one of the first coins on binance, and it was the top coin on binance for a long time. Whales got to this coin early, before binance took off. Bots and whales have suppressed the price after its initial bull run. There was the China FUD era, where China was shutting down projects (Walton got shut down for all of September), and they shut down exchanges, and Walton held a refund for all the Chinese ICO participants. Walton was at risk of being delisted as well, but ultimately didn't. For a long time, people thought Walton was a scam, because its team was TOO good. Yeah. It was *so* good, and people couldn't verify a lot of the information because it was Chinese, so people concluded it was a scam. To this day, there is still a \"walton is a scam\" post on google that comes up very high on the list of hits.\n\nWalton isn't doing well right now price wise, so I understand people shying away from it. But the fundamentals are solid. They have a lot of advantages over competitors. They have angel investors from the Korean Chambers of Commerce. They have a fleet of PhDs, and their chief scientist is the recent ex-VP of Samsung, who also worked at Honeywell and Bell Labs, holds 60 patents and has published over 250 academic papers and specializes in chip technology. They have connections with billion dollar apparel companies and they have many partnerships and customers who are multi-billion dollar companies already using their product in a testing phase. They have multiple govt contracts to build smart cities, oceans, and air purification systems.\n\nSo I don't know man. I'm just a guy on the internet. I look into projects and I do my research and I put my money where my mouth is. I'm not an expert, but you look me in the proverbial eye and tell me, after seeing what the project is doing, that it deserves rank 81. It's my opinion, the opinion of many other supporters, and the opinion of the CEO, that this coin should be a top 10 coin.\n", "sentences": ["Again, VeChain does not make their own chips.", "As for software, we won't know the organizational structure of the VeChain Thor blockchain, so we can't compare yet because we don't know the specifics of what it's capable of."], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514780521, "body": "REQ / ICX / XLM / XRB / VEN / ENG", "sentences": ["XRB / VEN / ENG"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781152, "body": "+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)", "sentences": ["+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781168, "body": "+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)", "sentences": ["+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781206, "body": "VeChain (VEN/VET)", "sentences": ["VeChain (VEN/VET)"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781351, "body": "ICX, VEN", "sentences": ["ICX, VEN"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781429, "body": "+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)", "sentences": ["+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781659, "body": "Add VeChain!!", "sentences": ["Add VeChain!!"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514781735, "body": "+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)\n\n- HUGE Partnerships (PWC, Renault, etc.)\n\n- Partnering with Chinese government to create a new smart city, \u201cthe Silicon Valley of China\u201d\n\n- Recently announced economic model that rewards HODLers with a second token (similar to NEO setup)\n\n- Plenty more to come in 2018\n", "sentences": ["+1 VeChain (VEN/VET)\n\n- HUGE Partnerships (PWC, Renault, etc.)\n\n- Partnering with Chinese government to create a new smart city, \u201cthe Silicon Valley of China\u201d\n\n- Recently announced economic model that rewards HODLers with a second token (similar to NEO setup)\n\n- Plenty more to come in 2018\n"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514782382, "body": "VeChain (VEN/VET)\n\n- HUGE Partnerships (PWC, Renault, etc.)\n\n- Partnering with Chinese government to create a new smart city, \u201cthe Silicon Valley of China\u201d\n\n- Recently announced economic model that rewards HODLers with a second token (similar to NEO setup)\n\n- Plenty more to come in 2018\n", "sentences": ["VeChain (VEN/VET)\n\n- HUGE Partnerships (PWC, Renault, etc.)\n\n- Partnering with Chinese government to create a new smart city, \u201cthe Silicon Valley of China\u201d\n\n- Recently announced economic model that rewards HODLers with a second token (similar to NEO setup)\n\n- Plenty more to come in 2018\n"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514782735, "body": "I agree with its potential.

This is simply an explanation and is not the only way or even the best way.\n\nFirst, figure out how much you are willing to completely throw away and lose. Is it 20000 or 20? Both are fine as long as you know good and well it can easily become 0 very quickly. This is a real question you need to deliberate.\n\nNext, once you decide that, choose an exchange you can trade fiat for crypto. Coinbase is an easy gateway and the choice for a lot of people. Is it the best? IDK but it's popular because it is easy.\n\nNext you need to decide what you want to invest in. You may decide to just hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum which can be bought and held on Coinbase if you choose.\n\nIf you are interested in alt coins, DO YOUR RESEARCH! Don't just buy into the flavor of the month because everyone else is. Read the coins white paper. See what the long term plan is. Who the developers are. Have they hit their goals on the road map? Are they working towards big partnerships? Invest in coins you believe in! Then just hold. Don't day trade. Find what you think can make it big and just hold the shit. I don't know how many posts show up a day talking about people starting to day trade and losing it all when if they just held, they probably would have doubled their investment.\n\nIf you pursue alt coins there are several ways to do it. You would need to move funds into an exchange. Again, Binance is a popular one for Americans. Some people like it, some people don't. You will have to read about them to figure out what works for you.\n\nIf you buy on Coinbase there are some exchange tricks where you can pretty much move the money for free. Otherwise there is going to be fees for moving the money around. I don't really suggest buying bitcoin with the intent to move it to an exchange because it's really slow and has high fees right now. Litecoin and Ethereum are better suited for this process right now.\n\nI think my biggest point here, and where I'll end this post is that you need to read. A lot. There is a ton of info and there is a skill gap that you need to overcome depending on your goals. Ask questions, look for answers.\n\nIll be glad to answer some here if you ask but if you aren't spending several hours a day reading about this stuff before you commit, you might not do well.

I am glad that you are not a BCH supporter and can see that Roger Ver is a con. So the reason why I got interested with Ripple is because I originally was interested in Litecoin. The failure that I see in litecoin and why Ripple is so attractive, comes down to leadership. Litecoin is failing hard because of Charlie Lee. He does not know how to market his product. After telling everyone to expect bearish markets, selling all of his coins, and then announcing that he is stepping away from litecoin after it comes back up a little....screams run away. That is when I started looking into Ripple and XRP. Even though most of the crypto community wants to see a completely decentralized, government and corporations hands off blockchain based currency that replaces fiat.....I don't feel that will ever happen, at least not in our lifetime. Ripple, at least to me, has the best chance at winning over the banking industry and the government and I feel that they will bring them to the crypto world. Your argument about XRP not being used, I feel may be misguided. Most of the Ripple community already knows that Ripple the company and XRP are not the same thing (except for newcomers of course), as the Ripple CEO and David Schwartz have been very transparent with this. Saying that XRP will never be used is a fallacy. Their Q3 report shows that they have sold ~$20 million worth of XRP to be used on xRapid with just the small number of banks (less than 100) they have signed up with their company now, meaning adoption is happening. It makes perfect sense to sell them the service (Ripple net) and then upsell the digital asset (XRP). Both Brad and David have been asked numerous times, what keeps banks from using their own blockchain....and their answer has always been nothing. They even help them with product development. Why? The same reason any business does, networking. Once a bank / financial institution sees the difficulty with implementing a good blockchain, they will ultimately end up using XRP. Take a look at Swift. Swift is who Ripple is looking to replace.....and so far is on track to do. Swift has been trying to implement their own blockchain technology but  it's not going very well, meanwhile Ripple has already held the Swell conference with major banks and financial institutions, building those bridges. This is why I feel that, in the end, the cryptos that have a strong team will end up going the distance, not winning (again i hate the NBA analogy as multiple cryptocurrencies can exist), but ultimately will exist.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.

A lot of people are betting on that. :)\n\nMy favorites right now for the next year or two are Request, Ripple, IOTA, Walton, OmiseGo, NEO, PowerLedger, SiaCoin, RaiBlocks, and Ardor/IGNIS. I\u2019m not looking to necessarily \u201cmoon\u201d on all of them but I look for teams/technologies that show potential and have a large potential market. \n\nGood luck in 2018 and Happy New Year!", "sentences": ["My favorites right now for the next year or two are Request, Ripple, IOTA, Walton, OmiseGo, NEO, PowerLedger, SiaCoin, RaiBlocks, and Ardor/IGNIS."], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514780414, "body": "Tl;dr - Walton is incredible and deserves top 10, not rank 81.\n\nTechnologically, Walton is without question ahead in the hardware department. Again, VeChain does not make their own chips. They outsource them. They're using RFIDs that are not made specifically with blockchain in mind, and re-purposing them for use with blockchain through API. Walton on the other hand is a world leader in chip technology. They've made significant improvements to their RFID chip including: anti-collision logic which reduces the probability of skipping; low voltage and low power consumption which allows the RFID to last for more than 20 years; dissymmetric encryption and decryption module for safer tag communication; a dedicated storage space for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information, which makes the tag content truly tamper-resistant; the ability to read and write to the blockchain independently without human intervention; and more, such as the ability to detect minute movements, and other sensing capabilities. They've won multiple awards from the Chinese National Government for their hardware, and they've received govt subsidies for mass production and a serial run of their product.\n\nAs for software, we won't know the organizational structure of the VeChain Thor blockchain, so we can't compare yet because we don't know the specifics of what it's capable of. But Walton uses a dual-chain blockchain with sub chains that are independent but can sync to the dual-chain with their unique cross-bridging tech they developed. No other blockchain has this exact system. This allows for theoretically infinite scalability.\n\nSo why is Walton rank 81? For the same reason fucking Hshare has over a billion dollar market cap, even though it's a scam. Because this market is irrational as hell. Walton used to be rank 28 just a couple months ago. It had a bull run before most other projects did. It was one of the first coins on binance, and it was the top coin on binance for a long time. Whales got to this coin early, before binance took off. Bots and whales have suppressed the price after its initial bull run. There was the China FUD era, where China was shutting down projects (Walton got shut down for all of September), and they shut down exchanges, and Walton held a refund for all the Chinese ICO participants. Walton was at risk of being delisted as well, but ultimately didn't. For a long time, people thought Walton was a scam, because its team was TOO good. Yeah. It was *so* good, and people couldn't verify a lot of the information because it was Chinese, so people concluded it was a scam. To this day, there is still a \"walton is a scam\" post on google that comes up very high on the list of hits.\n\nWalton isn't doing well right now price wise, so I understand people shying away from it. But the fundamentals are solid. They have a lot of advantages over competitors. They have angel investors from the Korean Chambers of Commerce. They have a fleet of PhDs, and their chief scientist is the recent ex-VP of Samsung, who also worked at Honeywell and Bell Labs, holds 60 patents and has published over 250 academic papers and specializes in chip technology. They have connections with billion dollar apparel companies and they have many partnerships and customers who are multi-billion dollar companies already using their product in a testing phase. They have multiple govt contracts to build smart cities, oceans, and air purification systems.\n\nSo I don't know man. I'm just a guy on the internet. I look into projects and I do my research and I put my money where my mouth is. I'm not an expert, but you look me in the proverbial eye and tell me, after seeing what the project is doing, that it deserves rank 81. It's my opinion, the opinion of many other supporters, and the opinion of the CEO, that this coin should be a top 10 coin.\n", "sentences": ["Tl;dr - Walton is incredible and deserves top 10, not rank 81.\n\n", "Technologically, Walton is without question ahead in the hardware department.", "Walton on the other hand is a world leader in chip technology.", "But Walton uses a dual-chain blockchain with sub chains that are independent but can sync to the dual-chain with their unique cross-bridging tech they developed.", "So why is Walton rank 81?", "Walton used to be rank 28 just a couple months ago.", "There was the China FUD era, where China was shutting down projects (Walton got shut down for all of September), and they shut down exchanges, and Walton held a refund for all the Chinese ICO participants.", "Walton was at risk of being delisted as well, but ultimately didn't.", "For a long time, people thought Walton was a scam, because its team was TOO good.", "Walton isn't doing well right now price wise, so I understand people shying away from it."], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514780466, "body": "I think WTC will actually implement its tech in the real world on a large scale.

To say no one wants this, and that it is a scam, is entirely false.\n\nedit: Sounds like you know nothing at all about this project, and are just blindly shitting on it. Here's a good read on why DBC is worth the attention: https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/7jakzh/why_is_deep_brain_chain_getting_so_much_attention/", "sentences": ["NEO team invested 1 million."], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514774184, "body": "&gt;To which coins would this apply? I\u2019d be interested to see what they\u2019ve done to address the problems.\n\nHonestly, I may have come across too confident there. There are attempts at solving the issue using different network consensus algorithms or incentives for participants or nodes that process/store the ledger. There are a lot of parameters being tweaked--like an experiment in game theory for good economic behavior (or in some cases getting the founders rich).\n\nFor example, some cryptocurrencies like NEO pay a sort of dividend to those that hold a stake, or there are others that include governance via voting based on stake, etc. Some cryptocurrencies need miners like bitcoin needs miners, some make miners win popularity contests or hold stake to get rewards. There are also various varieties of cryptocurrency with different degrees of decentralization and anonymity, which correlates with how much you need to trust the system or it's participants. What I mention above is by no means exhaustive, just a smattering of what people are trying.\n\nIOTA for example abandons the blockchain as a data structure for the distributed ledger all together, instead using a cloud or tangle of transactions that verify other transactions. It also gets rid of miners and hides parts of this transaction cloud from other parts of the cloud. It has a very weird way of doing the same thing as a blockchain with smart contracts, except using sort of a probabilistic rather than deterministic approach. It's confusing for investors to understand it and I'm not sure it will catch on, but it's very different.\n\nFor example, a blockchain contract gets satisfied when a condition is true after some exact timestamp. A hypothetical for now IOTA contract would (theoretically) get satisfied once enough time passes and the tangle can reach a consensus that a condition is true with probability X.\n\n&gt;Why bother buying the basket now, if you believe it\u2019s currently speculation-driven pricing? Or maybe I\u2019m missing the point? or you believe the settle-in pricing is still ahead of us?\n\nI originally invested for a bit less than a quarter and made enough that I took out my original investment, and am working with profits only now in the portfolio. It was a sort of leg in, a trial. From now on I am setting goals of taking out profits (50%) each quarter and rebalancing. Part of this is learning for me as well, as I think in 5 years I could pivot into a career in the sector and this way it's real, with some incentives to do well and stick with it.\n\nI do think a lot of the prices are speculation driven, however on the flip side this asset class is based on very fast technology by comparison to other markets. It's possible it's just getting funded faster than anything we've ever seen before, like how the internet has accelerated media and other things people used to spend more time having to create or do.\n\nAnyway, I think it's possible a portion of the value right now is supported underneath by something fundamental. The ICO market for example is funding more to startups than angel investors. Some of the value in a token like Ethereum is in it's use for that ICO system. So, in my mind, it's worth putting a little money in early in case it pays off. The risk is at most very minimal to my well being with what I have in it.\n\nThe technology alone is very game-changing, I feel that in my head more than my heart. My heart tells me the investors in this space shouldn't be called that. Still, we've seen tokens grow a ridiculous amount so it's possible one pays off pretty big, relatively speaking to the dollar amount in (I wont be a millionaire). However your mention of the regulatory wild card is absolutely spot on, and I do believe we're in a Bitcoin bubble.

To get a little more discussion about the tech and its competitors\n\nSo, [what is Loopring?](https://loopring.org/en/index.html) Loopring \"is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading.\" The protocol seeks to pool the liquidity of cryptocurrency's. It is an *agnostic protocol* that can be operated on any program that operates Smart Contracts. LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to \"put it all their eggs in one basket.\" \n\nLoopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology. To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. \n\nLoopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: \n\n* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, \n\n* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and \n\n* as a cross-platform protocol. \n\nAdditionally, the Dev team released their [2018 Road Map](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669), which contains realistic goals for the year. I'd really like to point out one tidbit of information:\n\n* \"For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. **For each LRC you buy and hodl**, within some time in Q1 and Q2 **you'll receive an equivalent amount of LRx tokens for Qtum and NEO.** \n\n[Blockchain Brad had a really good interview with Daniel, that helped share his vision and talent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA5zgPvDdjE) \n\nI hope this came off as educational, and not too shill-ish.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": [", ARK, LINK, etc.  "], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514848113, "body": "If you want to catch the next XRP or Raiblocks, you better buy LINK.

However all of them have been positive with gains well beyond the big coins. Of course in a true bear market where everything goes down, then as much as I hate to say it... back to fiat is probably the safest option. Personally I think that crypto is not a standard bubble, it is an adoption curve. As such it grows in bubbles and Gartner hype cycles. The Dec 2017 Hype cycle started before the Jan-Aug Hype cycle could die down, which I think is an inflexion point in worldwide crypto adoption. We may have short bear markets like with BTC now, but overall I think Crypto is going to get bigger and bigger rapidly over the next 3-5 years until it is ubiquitous.\n\nThere was a period with all the BTC forks this year where BTC was money badgering it up and gaining like a mofo, but December 2017 has been the tipping point for altcoins to boom.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["XRB, XRP?, XLM?"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514847114, "body": "Yes.

It is true that all of the nodes as of today are run by IOHK, the company currently developing Cardano. However, the next development milestone is to make the network truly decentralized. Source: https://cardanoroadmap.com/, under *Shelley (Decentralised)*. If this promise isn't fulfilled in Q2 2018, there will be an outrage among investors, and many might leave. Just like with Bitcoin, your ADA cannot be remotely confiscated, freezed or anything of that sort. Charles Hoskinson is adamant about this: https://youtu.be/-zftnG6BYu4?t=3201, and I expect much of the community feels this way as well.\n\nCardano will in fact have a governance and treasury system to make the platform sustainable. Stakeholders will be able to vote whether IOHK should continue to maintain Cardano after 2020 or someone else: https://youtu.be/-zftnG6BYu4?t=2883. Stakeholders will also be able to vote about protocol changes. For example, would Bitcoin holders vote to increase the blocksize to at least temporarily help with the high fees and long confirmation times? We'll never know because it's a handful of developers who decide this instead of the community. These developers may or may not be paid by people who want to cripple or centralize Bitcoin. In Cardano's case this governance system is not yet functional, but it is promised and expected, it's a huge selling point. If IOHK tried to keep Cardano in its current centralized state saying they'll decide what happens forever, that'd be a huge break of promise and investors' trust would vanish, the price would crash.\n\nIf there is a thing that would worry some people, it would be that 16.7% of ADA tokens are distributed to the three entities of the Cardano ecosystem: https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/monetary-policy/. I personally don't think this amount is excessive, and hopefully they'll use it wisely.\n\nAs for privacy, Cardano is exactly as private and linkable to your real-life identity as Bitcoin is. There is a possibility of having true privacy on the Cardano blockchain eventually, they are doing research on it. They only want to release a comprehensive solution, and not a half-baked \"sort of private, but not really\" one. Charles Hoskinson expands more on this topic here: https://youtu.be/-zftnG6BYu4?t=1505.\n\nThe \"SAD reality\" is people talking shit about Cardano without the knowledge or proof to back it up, while in my opinion it is the most ambitious and promising cryptocurrency project to date.

To get a little more discussion about the tech and its competitors\n\nSo, [what is Loopring?](https://loopring.org/en/index.html) Loopring \"is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading.\" The protocol seeks to pool the liquidity of cryptocurrency's. It is an *agnostic protocol* that can be operated on any program that operates Smart Contracts. LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to \"put it all their eggs in one basket.\" \n\nLoopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology. To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. \n\nLoopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: \n\n* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, \n\n* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and \n\n* as a cross-platform protocol. \n\nAdditionally, the Dev team released their [2018 Road Map](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669), which contains realistic goals for the year. I'd really like to point out one tidbit of information:\n\n* \"For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. **For each LRC you buy and hodl**, within some time in Q1 and Q2 **you'll receive an equivalent amount of LRx tokens for Qtum and NEO.** \n\n[Blockchain Brad had a really good interview with Daniel, that helped share his vision and talent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA5zgPvDdjE) \n\nI hope this came off as educational, and not too shill-ish. Obviously, I'd like to see this community grow, but also, this is an opportunity for investors to get into LRC early and receive benefits of getting LRx tokens for simply hodling. \n\nPerform your due diligence, and do your own research.", "sentences": ["I did want to raise some awareness about Loopring (LRC) though!", "Loopring \"is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading.\"", "LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to \"put it all their eggs in one basket.\" \n\n", "Loopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology.", "To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. \n\n", "Loopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: \n\n* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, \n\n* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and \n\n* as a cross-platform protocol. \n\n", "For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.\"\n\n", "*For each LRC you buy and hodl", "Obviously, I'd like to see this community grow, but also, this is an opportunity for investors to get into LRC early and receive benefits of getting LRx tokens for simply hodling. \n\n"], "sentiment": 0.1111111111111111}, {"time": 1514841188, "body": "Enigma, ADA, REQ, XLM, ICX, XRB, LRC, IOTA, Doge.\n\nAnd about BTC : The only question for me is when to get out before it's too late ?", "sentences": ["Enigma, ADA, REQ, XLM, ICX, XRB, LRC, IOTA, Doge.\n\nAnd about BTC : The only question for me is when to get out before it's too late ?"], "sentiment": 0.0}], "KMD": [{"time": 1514767537, "body": "Req, Raiden, Loopring, Walton, IOTA.

On their website, it prominently states \"Verge is a secure and anonymous cryptocurrency, built with a focus on privacy.\" They claim to provide this privacy by hiding users' IP addresses. Let's take a dive into what this means and what this website is doing.\n\nWhen you send a transaction across the network, you connect to the nodes to tell them you would like for them to include this transaction in the next block. Typically, you connect to these nodes over the \"clearnet\", or normal internet. The nodes you communicate with know the IP address you use to communicate with them. This IP address could be from your house, a coffee shop, a VPN, etc.\n\nVerge claimed several times over several months/years to hide this IP address information by concealing behind Tor or I2P. Tor and I2P are privacy technologies that can work to conceal your IP address. Thus, if you use these systems to connect to these nodes, these nodes receive a masked IP address, not the real one. This breaks an association between your IP address and the transaction.\n\nTor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\nHowever, **IP obfuscation alone does not mean the transaction is private**. In Verge's case, transactions still show money transferring from one specific address to another. This is because the blockchain itself is transparent. Look at any Verge transaction, [such as this one](https://verge-blockchain.info/tx/91bc7992f3fd7827e71430873cf16418d3a6cdd968dd731682f99e3d948f4657). Money is clearly transferred from one address to others. This is all public information.\n\nSuppose you used a completely transparent cryptocurrency to buy coffee at your local shop. Tor isn't going to help you, since they can associate this transaction with you. They now know the wallet balance, all previous and future transactions associated with this address, and where the money you received came from.\n\nThat's because Tor and I2P are separate from cryptocurrencies. Sure, they can be added on top of cryptocurrencies to provide certain protections. However, you can use Tor to connect to pretty much anything.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's move on to what this website is doing. This website is connected to a Verge full node. This node is simply receiving transaction broadcasts from other users. These could be from the actual senders of the transaction, or they could be from other nodes that are simply relaying them. Since the network is relatively small, it's easy to capture a \"rough guess\" regarding the likely origins of these transactions.\n\nThe website simply records the IP address it receives these requests from. It's also trivial to make sure these are not Tor IP addresses, since these are indexed by several sites [like this one](https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes).\n\nEven though Verge claimed to hide this IP address, you can see that in practice, this feature is very infrequently used. Even in the latest \"wraith protocol\" wallet, IP address obfuscation is NOT included. You must manually obfuscate it by downloading Tor separately and manually configuring it, completely independent of Verge.\n\n---\n\nThis speaks to the wider issue of privacy being really hard to obtain, and the claims being really hard to verify. Nothing is ever \"perfectly private\" unfortunately, so that's an easy way to spot false/misleading claims. However, make sure to ask really critical questions of how privacy is afforded, or else you will be caught up in hot air like with Verge.", "sentences": ["Tor can be used with any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Verge, etc.\n\n"], "sentiment": 0.0}, {"time": 1514841283, "body": "Your exactly right. \n\nHmmmm I sold XLM for DASH.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.

Devs *will* be paid to work on the tech, even if it's open source. Whether it's the community paying for them or private interests can make all the difference. Governance has similar implications. Someone will always be in control, better to have democratic models in place now. \n\nSteem and Bitshares have this on lock. District0x *will* have it on lock. Decred, of course, seems like a good one, too, but I'm not sure if I like it since it is only a currency and it's hard for me to get behind when I have experienced Steem and XRB transactions. On a meta-level, I am of course also very into Aragon, since it enables people to govern in a decentralized manner.\n\nXMR *almost* has this on lock. I'm not sure I fully understand it. They have self-funding, but I don't think they have a true governance model. This could pose problems.\n\nOnto the tech. I am super super excited for District0x. The concept of a WYSIWYG marketplace creation toolset along the lines of Wordpress seems super super cool to me. The easier it is to create dApps, the more dApps we will have. The more dApps we have, the more chances we get to launch dApps that result in mass adoption. Toolsets like this are always great projects to get involved with, because creating just *one strong and useful toolkit* can result in *thousands* of projects being launched. \n\nI'm excited for Steemit right now, because it just lines up so perfectly with the concept of incentives and market rewards and how cryptos gain value. Cryptos gain value from more people being aware of and buying them? Cool, let's create a platform where we *pay* content-creators and curators to create awesome content to bring awareness to this crypto. \n\nBitshares is great because it literally operates how you would expect an exchange to. This is miles ahead of something like Etherdelta, and it's clear from using Bitshares that Ethereum's block times would have never cut it for a dApp like this that needs fast processing. On top of that *it literally solves the tether problem*. Bitshares has created a system for minting USD-pegged and commodity-pegged crypto assets in a decentralized and trustless way. Why something like Tether is even still around with the existence of something like bitUSD or even bitGOLD as an alternative is truly beyond me.

You developed a plan and that's a start, you should follow thru with it.  \n\nShould you invest in a few large well known coins or many shot in the dark coins.  It really depends on your trading style and how risk adverse you are.  Personally with $500 I would try to double it as many times as possible.  BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, etc will probably double this year maybe 3x or 4x, probably not much more.  Then there are newer promising coins that could 5x, 10x, 15x and probably a few 20x.  XRB, XRP?, XLM?, ARK, LINK, etc.  There are also coins that could go 30x, 50x and perhaps 100x.  BNTY, DBC, PRL, KCS?, coins that haven't ico'ed yet.  \n\nI'm skipping over so much but in general making money in any market has to be about percentages.  Micro and Macro, micro the only measure of wealth is percentage gain/loss of initial investment, this is important to accept  this mentality exists, because the values could become very large.  Keep your eye on percentage of initial.  Macro percentages are in play all around and constantly in flux, find them where they have some stability, market caps.  Again fast forwarding quite a bit, basically lower market cap, with small total coins and low price will move the fastest when conditions are right.  They are also, again omitting quite a bit, most likely to just evaporate in to thin air.  Big risk, big reward.  \n\nI getting tired of writing so, from here on out I'm just going to tell you what I would do.  I would put 30 percent into BTC, 30 percent into ETH, 30 percent into either BCH(potentially insulate from a drop in BTC) or DASH.  Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.  Don't touch anything for at least a month, do as much research as possible on the coins you bought, watch their charts, keep up with their twitters, etc.  in your free time research low market cap coins and ICOs.  Identify at least three ICOs you like within the first two weeks.  Watch these and see how they perform.  Keep identifying new and upcoming projects.  After a month liquidated the highest percentage gain of one of your thirty percent investments.  Invest it into the coin your research leads you to believe the most promising or split between two coins.  Start actively trading these coins.  How you trade is entirely based own how risk adverse you are.  After three months you will be fully invested in alts.  Now is where I expect you have a decent grasp on how to interpret emotions thru charts, evaluate supply/demand thru watching order books, easily find information/news on specific coins, have a basic understanding of the underlying pressures in the market, etc.  Now, hopefully you have at least a few scars and more importantly at least a crisp $100 left, because it makes the math easy.  From here on out we want to take advantage of compounding funds.  Again risk adversion plays a big part, but we only started with $500 and have remained in the market for 4 months and learned a lot more than we would learned just by watching because we had skin in the game.  The goal is to double the remainder and cash out, reinvest and double again, so on and so forth.  If we start with a $100 and do this 14 times we have $1 million dollars.  If you took the entire $500 and invest by complete luck, insider knowledge, pure gut instinct, etc and you were to grab onto a 100x coin you would have 50k.  Either example is preferable to hitting zero, which is entirely possible also, it's really a question of how risk adverse are you?  Again skipped over a bunch, but you should have the ability to DYOR and fill in the blanks.  \n \nI you do register at kucoin use my referral code.  If you have questions about moving funds buying into the market (use gdax(coinbase's exchange) and ACH deposit for zero fees), feel free to PM me.\n\nI wrote this much so I might as well give a break down of a case study that I am currently interested in.  NXT was trading as low as $0.05-0.06 within the last three months.  It spiked at $2.50 ish(currently $0.6).  Some background NXT is platform, ARDR is NXT platform 2.0(next level shit), ARDR needs child chains to become NXT 2.0, enter stage left, IGNIS.  IGNIS is the first child chain of ARDR(NXT 2.0).  NXT sold IGNIS for NXT in a crowd sale with a round Robbin element.  First round 1 NXT gets you 2 IGNIS, next round 1 NXT : 1.5 Ignis and so on and so forth for five rounds.  Always look to follow money, when you do your independent research, pay particular attention to how the first two rounds went.  Always keep in mind Crypto it is an unregulated market,  your money is at total risk of loss at any moment with absolutely no recourse.  NXT also appealed to long term holder by issuing an airdrop for every NXT held you will get 0.5 IGNIS.  IGNIS will become live around the first of the year now, but prior we had futures and futures are trading very high, we currently have to wait and see, but for an example if you bought NXT at $0.10 and held for three months, your NXT would be worth $0.60, $500 into $3000.  You also would have gotten the IGNIS, not sure what the value will be but $500 @ $0.10/coin gives you 5000 coins or 2500 IGNIS at snapshot.  IGNIS futures are about $15 per IGNIS, now you have $37,500 if you could sell your IGNIS for $15.  So, 500 invested for three months without compounding could possibly have netted roughly 40k? Wowza!  These are the long shots you are looking for best of luck.\n\nKucoin referral code:\n\n1etJ7", "sentences": ["Take 10 percent and invest it in BNTY or DBC or RPX on kucoin.

As the previous ATH was reached because of all the FOMO on this sub. I however still think the concept is great and distributed governance as Aragon and District0x are working on is a great way to use the blockchain for something else than a way to transfer value. \n\nI'm a DNT holder and I'm not planning to sell any coins anytime soon. The concept is still very new and it is still not 100% clear what all the uses of the coin will be but I do think it will be very interesting to see how it is going to play out in terms of staking to acquire votes. Especially in districts that are successful. \n\nThe District0x team is developing some districts themselves so that the modules that will be used for the district framework (the wordpress for marketplaces) can be developed in parallel.  Since the FOMO here on this sub the team has launched https://namebazaar.io/ (marketplace running on eth smartcontracts to buy and sell ens names) and is actively working on the various modules on the fairly active github: https://github.com/district0x\n\nThe project itself seems to be moving fairly nicely. However, no real developments have been announced for the last weeks of 2017. Therefore, I don't know if the 30% price increase is fair. The team is working on the whitepaper for the next district (Memefactory) and will most probably go on after that to create 1hive (which I'm really excited for).  In parallel teams from Bloom, Bounty0x and many others are working on districts utilizing the district infrastructure. See the list of proposals here: https://github.com/district0x/district-proposals of course people will be able to create their own districts after the release of the district framework. \n\nIn terms of actual products I'm very optimistic the team has proven that they are able to create districts/marketplaces that not only look good but are user friendly and actually have a purpose. Both https://ethlance.com/ and namebazaar look really good. \n\nI do have to warn that as mentioned previously the usecase of the token is not very clear for everyone. It basically gives you a right to participate in the governance of each district within the network. You'll be able to decide on very basic subjects to much more interesting things as revenue sharing, usage of utility tokens etc. However, as this is still all at very early stages it is very difficult to understand without really reading the whole whitepaper of both District0x and Aragon.

Again, VeChain does not make their own chips. They outsource them. They're using RFIDs that are not made specifically with blockchain in mind, and re-purposing them for use with blockchain through API. Walton on the other hand is a world leader in chip technology. They've made significant improvements to their RFID chip including: anti-collision logic which reduces the probability of skipping; low voltage and low power consumption which allows the RFID to last for more than 20 years; dissymmetric encryption and decryption module for safer tag communication; a dedicated storage space for the storage of hash value of tag status and key information, which makes the tag content truly tamper-resistant; the ability to read and write to the blockchain independently without human intervention; and more, such as the ability to detect minute movements, and other sensing capabilities. They've won multiple awards from the Chinese National Government for their hardware, and they've received govt subsidies for mass production and a serial run of their product.\n\nAs for software, we won't know the organizational structure of the VeChain Thor blockchain, so we can't compare yet because we don't know the specifics of what it's capable of. But Walton uses a dual-chain blockchain with sub chains that are independent but can sync to the dual-chain with their unique cross-bridging tech they developed. No other blockchain has this exact system. This allows for theoretically infinite scalability.\n\nSo why is Walton rank 81? For the same reason fucking Hshare has over a billion dollar market cap, even though it's a scam. Because this market is irrational as hell. Walton used to be rank 28 just a couple months ago. It had a bull run before most other projects did. It was one of the first coins on binance, and it was the top coin on binance for a long time. Whales got to this coin early, before binance took off. Bots and whales have suppressed the price after its initial bull run. There was the China FUD era, where China was shutting down projects (Walton got shut down for all of September), and they shut down exchanges, and Walton held a refund for all the Chinese ICO participants. Walton was at risk of being delisted as well, but ultimately didn't. For a long time, people thought Walton was a scam, because its team was TOO good. Yeah. It was *so* good, and people couldn't verify a lot of the information because it was Chinese, so people concluded it was a scam. To this day, there is still a \"walton is a scam\" post on google that comes up very high on the list of hits.\n\nWalton isn't doing well right now price wise, so I understand people shying away from it. But the fundamentals are solid. They have a lot of advantages over competitors. They have angel investors from the Korean Chambers of Commerce. They have a fleet of PhDs, and their chief scientist is the recent ex-VP of Samsung, who also worked at Honeywell and Bell Labs, holds 60 patents and has published over 250 academic papers and specializes in chip technology. They have connections with billion dollar apparel companies and they have many partnerships and customers who are multi-billion dollar companies already using their product in a testing phase. They have multiple govt contracts to build smart cities, oceans, and air purification systems.\n\nSo I don't know man. I'm just a guy on the internet. I look into projects and I do my research and I put my money where my mouth is. I'm not an expert, but you look me in the proverbial eye and tell me, after seeing what the project is doing, that it deserves rank 81.

To get a little more discussion about the tech and its competitors\n\nSo, [what is Loopring?](https://loopring.org/en/index.html) Loopring \"is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reducing the cost of trading.\" The protocol seeks to pool the liquidity of cryptocurrency's. It is an *agnostic protocol* that can be operated on any program that operates Smart Contracts. LRC's vision is to run their protocol on the Top 10 Smart Contract platforms, so as not to \"put it all their eggs in one basket.\" \n\nLoopring is headed by Daniel Wang, who in prior professional lives was involved with Google, co-founder of various other start-ups, and has experience as a senior director and blockchain researcher at Zhongan Technology. To boot, Daniel Wang is friends with Hongfei Da (founder of NEO), who was an early investor in LRC. \n\nLoopring offers benefits to both users and exchanges by: \n\n* deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, \n\n* minimizing fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and \n\n* as a cross-platform protocol. \n\nAdditionally, the Dev team released their [2018 Road Map](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-2018-rnd-roadmap-33b423526669), which contains realistic goals for the year. I'd really like to point out one tidbit of information:\n\n* \"For both NEO and Qtum, we are fairly certain that the majority of LRN/LRQ will be distributed to, Ethereum based, LRC token holders based on a snapshot of each addresses LRC balance at certain block height, in the future.\"\n\nYes, you read that right. **For each LRC you buy and hodl**, within some time in Q1 and Q2 **you'll receive an equivalent amount of LRx tokens for Qtum and NEO.** \n\n[Blockchain Brad had a really good interview with Daniel, that helped share his vision and talent.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA5zgPvDdjE) \n\nI hope this came off as educational, and not too shill-ish.
